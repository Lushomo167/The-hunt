To use the hunt you have to be a member which means you have to sign up to it. To do this a sign up page will be provided. the sign page will consist of three parts: Personal information, Educational information and other once all three of these are complete, user may activate the job search which will search the web for all available vacancies depending on the users input. Once the search(which will be set for  week) is over all the information gathered is sent to the provided email. Users may hn select which offer is to there liking and apply for it.
